# Architecture decisions

Append-only log. Add an entry whenever you make a non-trivial architectural call
(new module boundary, library choice, scope cut, schema shape). Each entry: date,
the decision, alternatives considered, and *why*. Newest first.

## 2026-06-21 — Server mirrors client conventions

**Decision:** `:apps:server` reuses the client's stack — kotlin-inject + anvil DI
(`ServerScope`/`ServerComponent`), the `domain/` interface + `data/` impl split,
conventional commits, the version catalog. It's a plain JVM `application` module
(no convention plugin; those are KMP-only).

**Why:** one mental model across client and server. An agent (or human) moving
between them doesn't re-learn DI, error handling, or module layout. The cost —
the server can't use the KMP `:libraries:core` (`Catching`, logging) because that
module has no JVM target — was accepted; the server keeps a couple of small local
equivalents rather than forcing a `jvm()` target onto every client library.

## 2026-06-21 — Graceful degradation over required config

**Decision:** `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SENTRY_DSN`, and the OTLP endpoint
are all optional. With none set, the server boots and serves `/_health` +
`/v1/example`; DB-backed and authenticated routes simply aren't mounted, Sentry
no-ops, and OpenTelemetry exports to stdout.

**Alternatives:** require `DATABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_URL` like the Cards origin
(fail-fast). **Why optional:** this is a template — "clone and run, see it boot"
beats a fail-fast error on first run. The fail-fast discipline still applies per
field via `Env.require` when a future field genuinely can't be defaulted.

## 2026-06-21 — Auth is JWKS verification, never a shared secret

**Decision:** the server verifies Supabase JWTs against the project's public keys
(JWKS / ES256). The `JwtVerification` sealed seam has `Jwks` (prod) and `Static`
(tests mint HS256 tokens against a known verifier).

**Why:** no Supabase secret ever lives on the server, and auth — the highest-risk
surface — is fully testable offline (route tests + `FullStackMeTest` run the real
validate/challenge path with no network).

## 2026-06-21 — `NoOpAuthTokenProvider` lives in the `:networking` api module

**Decision:** the default no-op `AuthTokenProvider` binding sits in
`:libraries:networking` (api), not `:impl`.

**Why:** the module-boundary rule forbids one `:impl` depending on another, but
`:libraries:identity:impl` must reference `NoOpAuthTokenProvider` to override it
with `@ContributesBinding(replaces = [NoOpAuthTokenProvider::class])`. Putting the
default binding next to the interface it defaults keeps the replacement
boundary-clean. (See also the `enforceModuleBoundaries` self-edge fix in
`build-logic`.)

## 2026-06-21 — `serverOnly` build slimming

**Decision:** `-Dkmptemplate.serverOnly=true` makes `settings.gradle.kts` include
only `:apps:server`, so a Docker image build needs no Android/iOS toolchain.

**Why:** this is a KMP monorepo; without slimming, a server image build would
configure every client module and need the Android SDK + Kotlin/Native. The
server has no client-library deps today, so the gate is a pure settings change;
if it gains one, add an always-included `include(...)` + a Dockerfile `COPY`.

## 2026-06-21 — Flyway SQL is the schema source of truth

**Decision:** migrations under `resources/db/migration` define the schema; the
Exposed `Tables.kt` objects are read-side projections kept honest by
`DatabaseSchemaTest`. Repositories treat a unique-violation (SQLSTATE `23505`) as
the arbiter rather than pre-checking for races.

**Why:** one procedure for schema change (add the next `V##__name.sql`, never edit
an applied one), and idempotency that's correct under concurrency.

## 2026-09-09 — Ports considered and rejected

**Decision:** three things a downstream app offered back are deliberately not in
this template. Recorded so they don't get re-proposed each time someone reads
that app's setup and notices the gap.

- **Macrobenchmark `FrameTimingMetric` in CI.** The right tool for catching jank
  regressions, and it needs a real device. Emulator frame timing on a shared CI
  runner varies more run-to-run than the regressions worth catching, so any
  threshold produces flaky red and gets disabled within a month. Only worth it
  for a project with a device farm. Real-user frame timing (`app.jank`) covers
  the same question continuously and is in the template instead.
- **The Grafana dashboards themselves.** The queries encode one app's event
  names. The *conventions* are portable and already carried; the boards are not.
- **The observability routine and its skills.** Genuinely useful, and shaped
  entirely around one project's dashboards, alert ids and inbox. Revisit only if
  a second app wants the same thing — that is the point at which the generic
  shape becomes visible.

**Why here rather than the port queue:** the queue is work waiting to happen, and
these are closed questions. Keeping them there made an empty queue impossible.

## 2026-09-14 — Grafana dashboards stay out; the events registry comes in

**Decision:** this template ships no dashboard JSON and no dashboard contract
test. It does ship [telemetry-events.md](telemetry-events.md), a description of
what a generated project emits before anyone adds a feature.

**Why:** a downstream app re-proposed the dashboards with a sharper argument —
that more of its event surface is app-shaped than game-shaped, and that a
purchase-funnel board in particular is the one most likely to be wrong in a way
nobody notices. Both true. But its own recommended order starts with "decide
which events the template *guarantees* every generated app emits", and that is a
design decision nobody has made. A board querying an event a generated app might
not send reads zero forever and is indistinguishable from a real zero, which is
strictly worse than no board.

So the prerequisite landed and the boards did not. The registry is deliberately
worded as a description rather than a contract, because promoting it to a
guarantee is the decision still outstanding. Writing it surfaced one real bug
immediately: `conn.reconnecting` exists only in a test fixture, so any panel
built on it would have read zero forever.

The contract test that holds queries to emit sites is the genuinely portable
idea in that proposal, and it is worth writing the moment a generated project
has boards worth holding. Its traps are recorded at the bottom of the registry
so nobody re-derives them — in particular that a Gradle test task which does not
declare `inputs.files(...)` stays UP-TO-DATE and passes while checking nothing.
