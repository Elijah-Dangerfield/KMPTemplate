# Setup checklist — KMP Template

Action items after running `./scripts/init_project.main.kts`.

## Start here

```sh
./scripts/install_hooks.sh    # the build fails until you do this
./scripts/setup.main.kts      # walks everything below that can be automated
```

`setup.main.kts` runs the steps in the order their dependencies allow and skips
anything already done, so it is safe to re-run and safe to abandon halfway.
`./scripts/setup.main.kts --status` answers "where am I" without changing
anything.

What it can do for you, and what it can't:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **One command** | Supabase project + auth config, Sentry project + DSN + CI vars, Fly apps + secrets + deploy tokens, every signing secret |
| **Once per machine** | `gh auth login`, `fly auth login`, and filling the [credential store](#credential-store-do-this-on-your-second-project) |
| **Always by hand** | Play Console app entry + service-account invite + data safety + content rating, App Store Connect app record + listing, promoting the first release in each store |

The rest of this page is the detail behind each of those, plus everything the
scripts deliberately don't touch. Read the section for a step when it fails or
when you want to know what it did.

**Hour 1 — a running app:**
- [ ] [Local dev](#local-dev) — hooks + first build
- [ ] [Credential store](#credential-store-do-this-on-your-second-project) — skip on your first project
- [ ] [Supabase auth](#supabase-auth-hour-1) — project, providers, redirect URLs
- [ ] [Sentry](#sentry-one-script) — one script, then crash reporting is on everywhere
- [ ] [Server deploy](#server-deploy-flyio) — dev Fly app + secrets + `/_health`

**Day 1 — pipelines + visibility:**
- [ ] [GitHub secrets](#github-secrets-only-if-you-enabled-ci) (only if you enabled CI)
- [ ] [Repo settings](#repo-settings) — Pages, Actions, branch protection, the `production` Environment
- [ ] [Day-1 verification](#day-1-verification) — prove telemetry + deploys actually work

**Before shipping:**
- [ ] [Store listings](#store-listings) — Play Console + App Store Connect
- [ ] [First release](#first-release) — the manual-promotion gotcha
- [ ] [App icons](#app-icons)

---

## Local dev

```sh
./scripts/install_hooks.sh   # commit-msg hook for Conventional Commits
./gradlew build              # first sync + build
```

The Gradle build fails with an install-hooks message if you skip `install_hooks.sh`. That's intentional — release-please derives version bumps from commit history, so every commit must be in Conventional-Commits form (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).

To bypass in scripted contexts (not CI — `CI` env var is honored): `-Dkmptemplate.skipGitHooksCheck=true`.

---

## Credential store (do this on your second project)

```sh
./scripts/setup_credentials.main.kts
```

Most of what this checklist asks for belongs to your Sentry org, your Fly
account or your Apple team, and is identical for every app you generate. This
saves those answers once, on your machine, so the next project stops asking.
Everything here is optional: every setup script still prompts for whatever it
cannot find, and every script prints where each value came from before it
starts and what is still unset when it finishes.

On your first project there is nothing to reuse yet, so skip this and let the
scripts collect values as they go — each one offers to remember what you typed.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Lives at | `~/.config/appsetup/credentials.properties` by default, mode 0600, outside every repo. `--move-to ~/Documents/appsetup` puts it somewhere iCloud syncs, which the scripts also search — a backup for what you cannot regenerate, a wider blast radius for what you can. |
| Precedence | environment variable → store → prompt (so CI is unaffected) |
| Holds | Sentry org + tokens, Supabase + Fly tokens and org slugs, Apple team / key IDs, signing passwords, and the *path* to your signing folder |
| Does not hold | the signing files themselves, or anything per project — the Sentry project slug derives from the `applicationId`, the Fly app name from the project name |
| New machine | run the script again there |

`--list` shows what is set (secrets masked); `--clear` forgets it all; `--import <file>` reads an env-format file, which is the quick path if you already keep a folder of shared release secrets — the store's keys are named after the CI secrets so most of them land untouched. The file
holds live deploy tokens in plain text, so if you copy it between machines,
treat the copy like the tokens and keep it out of anything that syncs.

---

## Sentry (one script)

The app ships with crash reporting off: `telemetry.properties` has a blank
`sentry.dsn`, nothing initialises, and nothing costs anything at runtime. Turn
it on once and it is on for every developer and every build type:

```sh
./scripts/setup_sentry.main.kts
```

It asks for one thing, a Sentry **user** auth token, then creates or adopts the
project, writes the DSN into `telemetry.properties`, sets the CI variables, and
finishes by sending a real event and waiting for it to arrive. It prints
whether that worked. If it says the event did not arrive, the setup is not done
— the whole point of the check is that a broken Sentry setup otherwise looks
identical to a working one.

Re-run it any time; every step is an upsert.

**Get the right token.** Sentry has two kinds and they are not interchangeable:

| Token | Where | Scopes | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | Settings → Account → API → [Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) | Selectable — tick `project:read`, `project:write`, `org:read` | This script. Never written to the repo; saved to your [credential store](#credential-store-do-this-on-your-second-project) only if you say yes. |
| **Organization** (`sntrys_…`) | Settings → Organization Tokens | Exactly `org:ci`, not selectable | CI only (`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`). 403s every read endpoint, so the script cannot use it. |

Handing the script an organization token gets a 403 from the first call and
looks like a broken token. It isn't; it's the wrong one.

Then **commit `telemetry.properties`.** The DSN belongs in git. It is a
write-only ingest endpoint that ships inside every store binary — anyone can
read it out of a published build in minutes — so it is not a secret, and any
scheme where each developer configures it locally means fresh clones silently
report nothing.

Dev versus prod needs no extra work. One project takes everything; the
`environment` tag is `{releaseChannel}-{platform}-{buildType}`, giving
`dev-android-debug` through `store-ios-release`.

---

## GitHub secrets (only if you enabled CI)

Set under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. All are required for `release.yml` to ship.

**Do this once, not once per app.** Every value below except `SENTRY_PROJECT` belongs to your Apple team, your Play developer account, or your Sentry org, and is identical for every project this template generates.

```sh
./scripts/setup_github_secrets.main.kts            # or --dry-run first
```

pushes all of them. Keep the certificate, the `.p8`, the upload keystore and the service-account JSON in **one private folder outside any repo**; the script asks for that folder once and the [credential store](#credential-store-do-this-on-your-second-project) remembers the path (never the files). The passwords beside them are account-wide, so the store holds those too. A new app then costs two values, not fifteen. See [release-automation.md → Secrets and variables](docs/release-automation.md#secrets-and-variables).

Anything it can't find is reported with what that specific gap costs, and everything else still goes up — so a partial folder is a useful run, not a failed one.

**Your Play service account can cover every app.** Invite it at the *account* level (Play Console → Users and permissions → Invite new user → grant permissions for the whole developer account rather than per-app) and future apps are covered automatically, so the JSON you save today keeps working for app number five. Verify after your next app appears: the service account should already be listed against it.

The one item that cannot be reissued is the Android upload keystore: once an app has shipped a build signed with it, losing it means asking Google to reset the upload key. Everything else on this page can be regenerated from a console in minutes.

### Android signing

| Secret | How to get it |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64 -i upload-keystore.jks \| pbcopy` |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias inside the keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |
| `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Play Console → Setup → API access → create service account with *Release apps to testing tracks* + *Release apps to production*. Download the JSON. |

### Apple signing + App Store Connect

| Secret | How to get it |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer → Membership → Team ID |
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect → Users and Access → Keys → Key ID |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | Same page — Issuer ID (top of the Keys tab) |
| `ASC_KEY_P8_BASE64` | `base64 -i AuthKey_XXX.p8 \| pbcopy` |
| `APPLE_DIST_CERT_P12_BASE64` | Export your Apple Distribution cert from Keychain as .p12, then `base64 -i dist.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `APPLE_DIST_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting the .p12 |
| `FASTLANE_APPLE_ID` *(optional)* | Apple ID email, for `fastlane deliver` |

### Sentry

| Secret | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Sentry → **Settings → Organization Tokens** → Create New Organization Token (`sntrys_…`). Used by `beta.yml`/`release.yml` to create releases + upload mappings/dSYMs. Organization tokens carry exactly one scope, `org:ci`, and it is not selectable: release creation, source map upload, code mappings. That is all CI needs. Do **not** go looking for `org:read` or `project:releases` to tick; those belong to personal tokens and are not offered here. A healthy org token also answers 403 to Sentry's read endpoints, so do not treat that as a broken token. |

`./scripts/setup_sentry.main.kts` sets this one for you, along with the two
variables below, under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables** (not secrets):

| Var | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SENTRY_ORG` | Your Sentry org slug |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT` | Your Sentry project slug |

There is no `SENTRY_DSN` secret. The DSN lives in the committed
`telemetry.properties` — see [Sentry](#sentry-one-script) for why. The
environment variable is still read first, so you can point one workflow
somewhere else, but you should not need to. `release.yml` fails before it
builds anything if neither is set: a store build with crash reporting off ships
blind, and that is not something to discover from a review rejection.

### Grafana Cloud telemetry (optional)

Used by `beta.yml` and `release.yml` to bake client app-event credentials into
store builds. Leave unset and the telemetry pipe stays dormant — the app builds
and runs fine.

| Secret | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GRAFANA_OTLP_BASE_URL` | Grafana Cloud → OpenTelemetry → OTLP endpoint base URL |
| `GRAFANA_OTLP_INSTANCE_ID` | Same page — instance id (the numeric user) |
| `GRAFANA_LOGS_WRITE_TOKEN` | A Grafana Cloud access-policy token with logs:write. Grafana auto-revokes `glc_` tokens it finds in public repos — never commit one. |

### Server deploy (Fly.io)

```sh
./scripts/setup_fly.main.kts
```

creates both apps, points the fly configs at them, pushes the Supabase values
as Fly secrets, mints both tokens below into GitHub, and offers the first
deploy. Run `fly auth login` first. Creating apps is free — only the first
deploy starts a machine, and that step asks separately.

`server-deploy.yml` auto-deploys the dev server on pushes to `main` that touch
server paths; `server-deploy-prod.yml` queues a prod deploy behind a manual
approval. Requires the two Fly apps from `apps/server/DEPLOY.md`.

| Secret | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_DEV` | `fly tokens create deploy -a <project>-server-dev --expiry 8760h` |
| `FLY_API_TOKEN_PROD` | `fly tokens create deploy -a <project>-server-prod --expiry 8760h` |
| `ADMIN_API_TOKEN_DEV` *(optional)* | The dev server's `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` — lets the deploy upload the per-version config manifest (see `apps/admin/README.md`). Skipped with a warning if unset. |
| `ADMIN_API_TOKEN_PROD` *(optional)* | Same, for prod. |

Also create the **`production` GitHub Environment** (Settings → Environments →
New environment → `production` → Required reviewers → add yourself).
`server-deploy-prod.yml` pauses on it until a human approves the run — without
the environment the prod deploy runs unguarded.

---

## Repo settings

- **Actions** → enable workflows.
- **Pages** → Source: `Deploy from a branch`, Branch: `main` / folder: `/pages`. (The `pages.yml` workflow can also publish on push.)
- **Branch protection** on `main`:
  - Require PR.
  - Require status checks: `CI / Build + test`, `commitlint / Validate PR title`.
  - Require linear history (so release-please squash-merges cleanly).

---

## Store listings

Before `release.yml` can ship:

1. **Play Console** → Create app → fill out store listing, data-safety form, content rating, pricing/distribution. Create at least one internal track tester.
2. **App Store Connect** → My Apps → New App → pick the bundle ID that matches `apps/ios/fastlane/Appfile`. Fill out app info, pricing, privacy details. Note: Apple checks the binary's bundle name / display name for uniqueness at *delivery* time (ITMS-90129), not here — if your app name is a common word, the first upload may bounce; pick a more distinctive `CFBundleName`/`CFBundleDisplayName` in `apps/ios` and re-upload.
3. **TestFlight** external group: create a group named `External Testers` (or change `TESTFLIGHT_EXTERNAL_GROUP` in `release.yml`).
4. Privacy policy + terms of service URLs — the `pages/` folder generates these; once Pages is enabled they're at `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/privacy.html` etc. Paste the URLs into both store listings.

---

## First release

> **!!! READ THIS BEFORE YOUR FIRST RELEASE !!!**
>
> Google Play and Apple both reject automated production uploads until a manually-promoted build exists. `release.yml` detects this and routes the **first** release to:
>
> - **Play internal track** (not production).
> - **TestFlight internal** (not external, not App Store submission).
>
> You must then, **once**:
>
> 1. **Play Console** → Internal testing → Promote release → Production. Fill out the production rollout form manually.
> 2. **App Store Connect** → TestFlight build → Submit for review manually.
>
> From release #2 onward, the pipeline uploads straight to Play production (10% staged rollout) and submits to the App Store with phased release.

The release-please PR shows a `!!! FIRST RELEASE !!!` banner the first time around so this is hard to miss.

---

## App icons

Drop your icons into:

- **iOS** → `apps/ios/iosApp/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` (replace the placeholder set).
- **Android** → `apps/compose/src/androidMain/res/mipmap-*/` (replace `ic_launcher*.webp`).
- **Shared** (used by Compose splash, about screens, etc.) → `libraries/resources/src/commonMain/composeResources/drawable/`.
- **GitHub Pages** → `pages/app-icon.png`, `pages/favicon.png`, `pages/apple-touch-icon.png`.

---

## Networking

`:libraries:networking` ships a single configured `HttpClient` (plus an
authenticated variant) for every repo and data source to share.

**Set your base URL** — or deliberately don't. The shipped default leaves it
blank, which is a real configuration: an app with no API of its own still signs
in against Supabase and calls third parties by absolute URL. A *relative* path
with no base URL is rejected before it leaves the device, with a message naming
what to set. That is on purpose — Ktor would otherwise resolve it against
`http://localhost`, and the refused connection would trip the offline banner,
so an unconfigured project would present as offline on a device with full
signal.

Bind your own `NetworkConfig` (see `DefaultNetworkConfig`) somewhere in your
app — typically a class that reads the URL from BuildConfig per build variant:

```kotlin
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
@ContributesBinding(AppScope::class, replaces = [DefaultNetworkConfig::class])
@Inject
class AppNetworkConfig : NetworkConfig {
    override val baseUrl = AppBuildConfig.API_BASE_URL
}
```

**Authenticated calls.** Inject `NetworkClient` and use
`networkClient.authenticatedClient` for endpoints that need a Bearer token.
The token comes from your `AuthTokenProvider` binding (default is no-op).
401s trigger `refreshAccessToken()`.

**Wrap calls with `Catching { }`** at the call site. Ktor throws on non-2xx
and network errors; the rest of the codebase already uses this pattern.

**JSON config.** `NetworkJson` is strict in debug (unknown keys/missing
fields throw) and lenient in release (so a backend tweak can't crash users).

## Supabase auth (hour 1)

The app ships with anonymous-first Supabase auth wired end to end (guest
creation in onboarding, email/password + Apple + browser-OAuth sign-in,
encrypted session storage, `/v1/me` profile).

```sh
./scripts/setup_supabase.main.kts
```

does steps 1 to 4 below — creates the project, turns on anonymous sign-ins,
sets the redirect URLs, authorizes your bundle ID for Apple, and writes
`local.properties`. It needs a Supabase personal access token (`sbp_…`) from
<https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens>, which the credential store
keeps for next time. It prints the generated database password **once** — save
it, the API will not hand it back.

The steps below are what it does, and what to do if you'd rather do it by hand
or something failed:

1. Create a Supabase project (free tier is fine). Note the project URL and
   the **publishable (anon) key** (Settings → API Keys).
2. Client config — add to `local.properties` (or export as env vars in CI):
   ```
   supabase.projectId=<ref>
   supabase.url=https://<ref>.supabase.co
   supabase.anonKey=<publishable key>
   ```
3. Enable providers in the Supabase dashboard (Authentication → Providers):
   **Anonymous sign-ins** (required for the guest flow), **Email**
   (confirm-email on), and optionally **Apple** / **Google**.

   **Apple is set-and-forget here, and it is worth knowing why.** This app
   signs in with Apple *natively* on iOS — the system sheet returns an identity
   token, which goes to Supabase as `signInWith(IDToken)`. Supabase validates
   that against the **Authorized Client IDs** list, so the only thing to fill in
   is your iOS bundle ID. Leave the Services ID and Secret Key fields empty.
   Nothing expires and there is nothing to rotate.

   Those two fields belong to Apple's *browser* OAuth flow, which this template
   does not use. That flow needs a Services ID plus a client-secret JWT capped
   at six months, so turning it on signs you up for a recurring chore. You would
   only need it to offer Apple sign-in on Android. Apple's button is iOS-only
   here (`AndroidAppleSignInCoordinator` is a deliberate no-op).
4. Redirect URLs (Authentication → URL Configuration): add your custom
   scheme callbacks so browser OAuth and the verify-email link return to
   the app:
   ```
   <yourscheme>://login-callback
   <yourscheme>://auth/confirmed
   ```
   The scheme is your project's lowercase name (see the intent filter in
   `AndroidManifest.xml` / `CFBundleURLTypes` in `Info.plist` — both already
   enabled).
5. Server env (see `apps/server/.env.example`): `SUPABASE_URL` for JWT
   verification, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if you want in-app account
   deletion (`DELETE /v1/me`) and display-name mirroring. Treat the service
   role key as a root password — server secrets only, never the client.
6. Verify: launch the app → complete onboarding as a guest → a user appears
   in Supabase → Authentication → Users with `is_anonymous = true`, and
   `GET /v1/me` (through the app) creates the profile row.

## Deep links

Compose NavHost handles the routing once URLs reach it. Per-route deep
links go on `screen<Route>(deepLinks = ...)` — use `routeDeepLink<T>()`,
never bare `navDeepLink` (iOS crashes on the missing base-route NavTypes).

The custom-scheme wiring is already enabled on both platforms (the auth
flows depend on it): the intent filter in
`apps/compose/src/androidMain/AndroidManifest.xml` and `CFBundleURLTypes`
in `apps/ios/iosApp/Info.plist`. For https App/Universal Links, add the
`assetlinks.json` / `Associated Domains` + AASA setup alongside.
`iOSApp.swift` forwards every `.onOpenURL` event to the Kotlin
`DeepLinkBridge`; `App.kt` routes OAuth callbacks to the auth layer and
everything else into the nav graph.

## In-app review

Inject `ReviewPrompter` and call `requestReview()` from a delighted-user
moment (e.g. after the user completes a meaningful task, or after N
sessions). The OS owns the throttling decision — both stores rate-limit how
often the dialog actually shows. Don't show your own UI before/after.

## Day-1 verification

Prove the observability + deploy story end to end while everything is fresh.
Each check has a definitive pass signal; if one fails, fix it now — these are
the tools you'll be debugging with later.

1. **Server is live.**
   ```sh
   curl https://<your-app>-server-dev.fly.dev/_health
   ```
   Expected: `{"ok":true}`.
2. **Client → server round trip.** Launch the app (device or simulator),
   complete onboarding as a guest. Expected: a new user in Supabase →
   Authentication → Users with `is_anonymous = true`, and a row in the
   `profiles` table.
3. **Find your session in Loki** (if Grafana is wired). In Grafana → Explore →
   Loki, query your client logs by the app's service name and filter
   `session_id="<id>"` — grab the id from the app's debug shake dialog or
   logcat (`Session started`). Expected: the `app.launched` event and your
   request logs, and the SAME `session_id` on the server's request logs.
4. **Trigger a test crash → Sentry.** Requires
   [`setup_sentry.main.kts`](#sentry-one-script) to have run and
   `telemetry.properties` to be committed — with a blank DSN the SDK never
   initialises and this check has nothing to find. Debug builds: shake → QA
   dialog → the test-crash affordance (or add a temporary `error()` behind a
   button). Expected: the event in Sentry within a minute under environment
   `dev-<platform>-debug`, tagged with `session_id` and `commit_sha`. The setup
   script already proved ingest works, so if the script passed and this does
   not, the problem is in the app build, not in Sentry.
5. **Config round trip.** Open the admin console (`/admin` on the dev
   server, paste your `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`), flip `upgrade.maintenanceMessage`
   to a test string, foreground the app twice (refresh is throttled).
   Expected: the value changes in the QA config dashboard; the audit tab
   records your change.
