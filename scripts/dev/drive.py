"""Drive the app on a connected Android device or emulator, by *text*.

Exists so an agent can verify UI work without a human at the screen: launch the
app, read what is on it, tap something by its label, capture a PNG.

    scripts/dev/drive.py launch [--fresh]
    scripts/dev/drive.py text
    scripts/dev/drive.py tap "Continue"
    scripts/dev/drive.py shot /tmp/home.png
    scripts/dev/drive.py --dry-run launch       # print the adb commands only

Tapping by coordinate breaks every time a layout shifts or the app boots a
second slower, so nothing here takes coordinates. It dumps the accessibility
tree, finds the node whose label matches, and taps its centre, retrying until
the node appears.

`launch` uses `am start`, deliberately, and NOT `monkey -p <pkg> -c LAUNCHER 1`.
Monkey is the obvious way to start an app by package name and it is the wrong
one: its trailing number is not a repeat count, it is how many pseudo-random
input events monkey fires *after* the app comes up. Every launch injects one
stray event into the first frame.

Measured downstream, from a clean install: 1 launch in 16 ended up somewhere
other than where it should have been, once leaving the device on the launcher
entirely. During one verification session it closed a launch-gate banner twice
and wrote a persisted dismissal, which made the feature under test look broken.

Roughly 6% is the number that makes this worth a comment rather than a commit
message. Tooling that fails outright gets fixed. Tooling that acts on the app
occasionally makes every screenshot after it one interaction ahead of where you
think you are, and the app takes the blame.

`text` and `content-desc` are the only labels visible here. A `uiautomator` dump
carries no state-description attribute, because `getStateDescription()` is
readable only by an accessibility service. A control that puts its identity in
`contentDescription` and its state in `stateDescription` — the correct split —
reads here as if the state were missing. Identical output from this script is
therefore not evidence that two states are announced the same way, and a bug has
already been filed once against a control that was announcing itself correctly.

    The scanning version looked for `(text|content-desc)="..."` followed by
    `bounds`, which reads as equivalent and is not. uiautomator emits `text`
    before `content-desc` on every node, so on a node with `text=""` the
    alternation matched the empty text, ran on to that node's `bounds` and
    consumed the element — and `finditer` does not overlap, so the real
    `content-desc` was never seen.

    Nodes labelled *only* by a content description were therefore invisible,
    and it failed in the least helpful way: icon buttons and custom-drawn
    controls are exactly that kind of node, so `tap` reported "never found" for
    a control plainly on screen while anything with visible text worked, which
    reads as a labelling bug in the app.

    Parsing per element fixed that and left a second bug behind. Attribute
    values in the dump are XML-escaped, so a label reading `Cats & dogs` came
    back as `Cats &amp; dogs` and tapping the text actually on screen did not
    match. A real parser decodes entities; a regex hands back the source.

    A node can carry both a `text` and a `content-desc`. Both are yielded, so
    either spelling can be tapped.
