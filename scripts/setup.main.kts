/**
 * Walks the setup steps in the order their dependencies allow, offering each
 * one and skipping anything that does not apply.
 *
 * Every step is also a standalone script. This exists because the *order*
 * matters and is not obvious: Supabase has to exist before its values can be
 * pushed to Fly, and both GitHub-facing steps need a repo that does not exist
 * at the moment a project is generated. Running the pieces in the wrong order
 * does not fail loudly — it half-configures things and leaves you to work out
 * which half.
 *
 * Re-runnable. Every step underneath is an upsert, so a second run repairs
 * drift rather than duplicating anything. That is what makes "skip it for now"
 * a safe answer to any of them.
 *
 * Run from the project root:
 *   ./scripts/setup.main.kts
 *   ./scripts/setup.main.kts --status   # what is done and what is not, no changes
