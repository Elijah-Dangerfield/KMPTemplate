/**
 * How long a host may claim to be off screen before a touch on it counts as a
 * contradiction rather than a race.
 *
 * Generous on purpose. The window this has to clear is the real one between a
 * full-screen presentation being dismissed and the host's lifecycle catching
 * up, which is milliseconds. Seconds of it means the host is not catching up at
 * all.

/**
 * Reports a press that lands on a host which has claimed to be off screen for
 * longer than [threshold].
 *
 * The navigation queue drains only at or above `STARTED`, which is correct, and
 * leaves the app dependent on the host telling the truth about its own
 * visibility. On iOS a full-screen UIKit presentation over the Compose host can
 * leave that claim stuck after the view is visible again, and from then on
 * every navigation queues and nothing moves.
 *
 * **A touch is the only signal that is never ordinary.** A host below `STARTED`
 * is completely routine: it is what happens on every backgrounding and behind
 * every full-screen interstitial. Logging that state would be one error per ad
 * and would train everyone to ignore it. But a covered view is not touchable,
 * so a press arriving while the host says its view is off screen is a
 * contradiction, and the host is the half that is wrong. That single
 * observation is what turns an unfalsifiable "sometimes it wedges" into
 * something detectable, and then into something repairable.
 *
 * `PointerEventPass.Initial` so this sees the press before any child consumes
 * it. Nothing is consumed here, so the press still reaches whatever it was
 * aimed at. Detection only.
 *
 * The obvious alternative, ungating the drain, is worse: it removes the
 * protection in the ordinary case to fix the rare one. Gate the repair on the
 * proof instead, which is what [onWedgeDetected] is for.
