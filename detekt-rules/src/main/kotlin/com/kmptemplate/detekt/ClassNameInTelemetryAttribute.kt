/**
 * Flags a telemetry attribute whose value is a class name — `::class.simpleName`
 * and friends — because R8 renames those in release builds and the dashboard
 * keeps filtering on the original.
 *
 * ## What this looks like when it bites
 *
 * A panel reads zero on Android while the store console shows the events it is
 * meant to be counting. Nothing errors, nothing is logged, and the panel is not
 * empty — the other values in its filter still match, so it looks like a real
 * decline. iOS is unaffected, which makes it read as a platform bug rather than
 * a build one.
 *
 * Downstream, `logEvent("iap.purchase_result", "outcome" to result::class.simpleName)`
 * shipped a whole release that way. `PurchaseOutcome.Success` is a plain sealed
 * object: not `@Serializable`, not a `Throwable`, so no keep rule covered it.
 * A real minified build's `mapping.txt` had it renamed to `ta.l`, and the
 * attribute arrived as the letter `l` while the dashboard filtered on
 * `outcome="Success"`. A quarter of that release's purchase data was
 * unattributable.
 *
 * ## Why this repo is exposed even though it has no dashboards
 *
 * Minification is on, and the only name-keeping rule in `proguard-rules.pro` is
 * `-keepnames class * extends java.lang.Throwable`. Every `::class.simpleName`
 * here today is inside a log *message*, which a human reads — an obfuscated name
 * there is ugly, not wrong, and this rule deliberately leaves those alone. The
 * moment one is fed to `logEvent` it becomes a machine-queried value, and the
 * value is whatever R8 chose.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * Give the type an explicit `val name` literal and emit that. A `-keepnames`
 * rule also works and is worse: the dashboards are keyed on these strings, and
 * nobody renaming a class will think to open a ProGuard file.
 *
 * ## Two things checked on the way, so they are not re-derived
 *
 * - `Throwable` names ARE kept by the rule above, so `simpleName` on an
 *   exception is safe.
 * - Enum `.name` survives minification even though R8 renames the constant
 *   fields, because the string is baked into the class initializer —
 *   disassembling `<clinit>` shows the `const-string` intact.
 *
 * ## Limit, stated honestly
 *
 * This matches on source text at the call site. A class name laundered through
 * a helper — `logEvent("e", "k" to describe(result))` where `describe` reads
 * `::class.simpleName` — is invisible to it. It catches the direct form, which
 * is the form people write.
