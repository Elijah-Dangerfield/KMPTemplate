/**
 * Flags a hand-rolled scroll container inside a `BottomSheet` / `BasicBottomSheet` content lambda.
 *
 * Material3 derives the sheet's Expanded anchor from the sheet's *measured* height, recomputes the
 * anchors on every measure pass, and snaps to the recomputed target whenever the new anchors differ
 * from the old. Content that decides its own height can be re-measured mid-drag and yanked back to
 * Expanded: dragging down to close jumps, and near the top the sheet bounces indefinitely without
 * ever closing. It only bites once the content is tall enough to be clamped against the available
 * height, so a hand-rolled scroll can sit in the codebase for a year and then break on the first
 * long sheet.
 *
 * `BottomSheet(scrollableContent = true)` owns the scroll *and* pins the sheet to the full height,
 * so every recompute produces identical anchors and there is nothing to snap to.
 *
 * Matched by name, with no type resolution: the callee must be exactly `BottomSheet`, and the
 * scroll call must sit inside one of its lambda arguments. Two deliberate omissions — Material's
 * own `ModalBottomSheet`, which is what the design-system wrapper is built on top of, and
 * `BasicBottomSheet`, whose sticky top and bottom regions mean its middle *is* meant to scroll on
 * its own and where `scrollableContent` would therefore be the wrong advice.
