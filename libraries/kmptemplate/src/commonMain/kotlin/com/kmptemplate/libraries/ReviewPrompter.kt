 * successful task completion, or after N sessions) and don't sweat whether
 * the dialog actually appears. The OS decides.
 *
 * - iOS: `SKStoreReviewController.requestReview` — silently no-ops if the
 *   user has been prompted recently or has reviewed already.
 * - Android: Play Core ReviewManager — same throttling story.
 *
 * Caller decides the trigger. This interface intentionally doesn't bake in
 * "after N sessions" heuristics because every app's right moment is different.
