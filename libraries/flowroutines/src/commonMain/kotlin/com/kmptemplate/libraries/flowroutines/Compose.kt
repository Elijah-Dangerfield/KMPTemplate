/**
 * The one place lifecycle-gated collection happens, so it is also the one place
 * that says so out loud.
 *
 * A `repeatOnLifecycle` collector is a spot where the app can go quiet without
 * going wrong: the collector detaches below [state], the producer keeps
 * producing, and nothing in the logs marks the moment. Chasing a stall that way
 * means inferring the lifecycle from what *stopped* appearing, which is a slow
 * way to learn something the framework already knows. So both edges are logged —
 * entry, and a `finally` for the exit — tagged with what is being collected.
 *
 * Pass a [tag] that names the producer, not the screen. "what stopped arriving"
 * is the question the log has to answer.
