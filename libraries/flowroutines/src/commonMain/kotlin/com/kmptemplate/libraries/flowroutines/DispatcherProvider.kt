/**
 * The scope for work that has to outlive the screen that started it: config
 * refreshes, queued navigation, anything fired and forgotten at app level.
 *
 * ## Why it catches
 *
 * A [SupervisorJob] keeps one failed child from cancelling its siblings, which
 * is what people reach for it for — and it is also what makes them stop
 * looking, because it does nothing about an exception nobody catches. That one
 * goes to the platform's default handler, which on Android ends the process.
 * With no handler here, every `appScope.launch` in the app is one uncaught
 * throw away from killing the app wherever the user happens to be. A
 * downstream app shipped exactly that and died at launch on a release build,
 * when a background sign-in coroutine hit a lifecycle registration made off
 * the main thread.
 *
 * So a failure is logged rather than fatal, and the logging is the point:
 * `KLog.e` carries the throwable to Sentry through `SentryLogTree`, so the
 * report that makes a bug like that findable still arrives. A debug build
 * rethrows, because locally the loud version is the useful one. That is the
 * same shape as `Catching {}.logOnFailure().throwIfDebug()`, which is how the
 * rest of the app treats a failure it cannot act on.
 *
 * None of which is a licence to skip handling errors where they happen. A
 * handler this far out knows only that something failed, so it cannot retry,
 * fall back, or tell anyone. Anything that can do better should still do it at
 * the call site.
 *
 * Cancellation never reaches here — the machinery treats it as normal
 * completion rather than as a failure, so there is nothing to filter out.
