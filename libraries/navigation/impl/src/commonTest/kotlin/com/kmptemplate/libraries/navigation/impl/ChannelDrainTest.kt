/**
 * Covers the drain the navigation watchdog uses to release a wedged queue.
 *
 * Split from `DelegatingRouter` precisely so it can be tested: the router's
 * commands are `NavHostController.() -> Unit`, and a controller needs a real
 * host. The loop is where the behaviour worth pinning lives.
 *
 * NOT covered here: whether the queue *should* be drained. That is the
 * watchdog's judgement, and it rests on a touch landing on a host that claims
 * to be off screen, which has no unit-testable form.
