/**
 * The two claims [FloatingWindowHost] makes that are *about composition*, which is why they are
 * here and not in a view-model test.
 *
 * First, that a window popped before it ever composes is still released. The host completes a
 * navigator transition from `onDispose`, and what never composes never disposes, so without the
 * sweep `NavController` holds that entry below CREATED and never clears its `ViewModelStore`,
 * pinning it and everything it references for the life of the process. Second, that a window which
 * does compose gets its own back stack entry as the owner of its state, so a sheet's `ViewModel`
 * dies with the sheet rather than with the activity.
 *
 * **Not covered, and not an oversight: the `windowsToDispose` guard in the sweep.** Deleting it
 * leaves both tests green, and nothing driving this host from outside can turn it red. The guard
 * only bites if the sweep runs while an entry is off the back stack *and* still composed, and that
 * state does not survive into the sweep: leaving the back stack is what removes the window from the
 * composition, Compose runs `onDispose` during that same apply pass, and the sweep body is a
 * coroutine dispatched afterwards, by which point the entry is out of `windowsToDispose` and
 * already complete. Checked rather than assumed: instrumenting the guard to report every time it
 * suppressed a completion printed nothing across a single pop, two windows popped in one
 * `NavController` call, a pop and a push in the same block, and a pop stepped frame by frame with
 * the clock held. It stays because it is upstream `DialogHost`'s shape, and because it goes back to
 * being load-bearing the moment the `DisposableEffect` moves into a subcomposition (as upstream's
 * does) and disposal stops landing in that same pass.
 *
 * Two more mutations survive, for reasons worth knowing before you trust this file. Either
 * visibility path alone: `PopulateVisibleList`'s `ON_START` branch and `rememberVisibleList`'s own
 * filter are redundant with each other on this flow, so breaking one still shows the window
 * (breaking both is red). And the sweep's back stack check, because completing the transition of an
 * entry that is still on the stack promotes it to RESUMED rather than destroying it, which is
 * invisible to a test that only asserts on release.
