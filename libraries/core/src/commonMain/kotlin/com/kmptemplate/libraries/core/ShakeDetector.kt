/**
 * Turns the accelerometer into a stream of shakes.
 *
 * [start] and [stop] are foreground-scoped, not composition-scoped: a detector
 * left running while the app is backgrounded keeps sampling a phone in a
 * pocket, and anything downstream that queues work until the app is visible
 * will replay that jostle as a user gesture on resume. Bind with
 * `LifecycleStartEffect`, never `DisposableEffect`.
 *
 * [shakeEvents] is a broadcast stream that drops rather than buffers. A shake
 * is only meaningful in the moment it happens, and a single-consumer channel
 * here means two collectors silently split the events between them instead of
 * both seeing each one.
