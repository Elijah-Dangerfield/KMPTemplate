/**
 * The shake gesture itself, with no sensor API anywhere near it.
 *
 * Platform detectors used to each carry their own copy of this logic, and the
 * copies drifted: one divided the delta by elapsed time and measured m/s², the
 * other measured raw multiples of gravity and never divided, so the same
 * physical shake needed roughly twice the effort on one platform. Neither could
 * be unit tested, because a test cannot construct a `SensorEvent` or a
 * `CMAccelerometerData` — which is why a baseline bug in this logic survived as
 * long as it did. Feed it plain numbers instead, and the rules become assertions.
 *
 * Callers hand it accelerometer samples in **m/s², including gravity** — the
 * unit conversion is the platform's job. It tracks the change between
 * consecutive samples, so a constant gravity vector cancels out and only
 * movement counts.
 *
 * ### Why the thresholds are what they are
 *
 * The inherited tuning was two qualifying samples anywhere inside a full
 * second, over a bar of 8.0 m/s² of change. Both halves were too loose. 8.0 is
 * under 1g of *change*, which a firm set-down on a table clears on its own, and
 * giving two of them a whole second to find each other means any two unrelated
 * bumps in the same second read as a shake.
 *
 * [REQUIRED_SAMPLES] qualifying samples inside [BURST_WINDOW_MS] asks for
 * roughly 6Hz of sustained direction reversal — what a hand shaking a phone
 * does, and what nothing else in ordinary handling does. Widening the window or
 * dropping the count brings the phantom dialogs back.
