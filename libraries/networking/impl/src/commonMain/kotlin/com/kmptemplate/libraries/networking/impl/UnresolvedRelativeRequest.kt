/**
 * Blocks requests that Ktor would otherwise quietly send to `http://localhost`.
 *
 * A blank base URL is a legitimate configuration, not an error: an app with no
 * backend of its own still signs in against Supabase and calls third-party APIs
 * by absolute URL, and demanding a base URL it has no use for would be wrong.
 *
 * What is not legitimate is a *relative* path with nothing to resolve it
 * against. Ktor's `URLBuilder` defaults to `http://localhost`, so the request
 * is sent, the connection is refused, and — because nothing answered — the
 * witnessed-reachability validator in [applyCommonConfig] correctly concludes
 * the round trip failed and reports the device unreachable. The app raises its
 * offline banner. So a project that has simply not set its base URL yet
 * presents as **offline**, on a device with four bars, and the first place
 * anyone looks is the connectivity code.
 *
 * That is the same failure shape as a blank Sentry DSN: a supported value that
 * silently means "off", where off is indistinguishable from working. Here it is
 * worse than silent, because it actively accuses something else.
 *
 * The check is narrow on purpose. It fires only on Ktor's exact untouched
 * default — http, host `localhost`, the protocol's default port — which is what
 * an unresolved relative path produces and is not what anyone configures for a
 * local dev server (those carry a port, or `10.0.2.2` on the Android emulator).
 * Someone who genuinely wants port 80 on localhost sets it as their base URL,
 * and the message says so.
