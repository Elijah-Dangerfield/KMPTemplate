/**
 * Slides this element whenever its parent places it somewhere new, instead of letting it teleport.
 *
 * It knows nothing about *why* the element moved: a changed alignment, a reordered row, a tooltip
 * following a new anchor all look the same from here. Put it on the thing that should travel and
 * let whatever positions it stay a plain, synchronous layout.
 *
 * That split is the whole point. Animating inside the positioning component is the tempting version
 * and it goes wrong the same way every time: an animation needs a coroutine, a layout pass cannot
 * start one, so the placement maths gets dragged up into composition where the content's measured
 * size is not known yet — and out fall a sentinel for "not measured yet", a hidden first frame, and
 * a measure → state → layout loop.
 *
 * Two details that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - **The first placement snaps.** There is nowhere to travel from, and springing in from the
 *   parent's origin is an entrance animation nobody asked for. [Animatable] starts at the first
 *   placement, so the offset it yields on that pass is exactly zero.
 * - **The spring is read inside `offset { }`, never in composition.** A `by animateTo…` read in a
 *   composable body would recompose this whole subtree on every frame of the travel. Read from the
 *   layout lambda, the movement invalidates placement only.
