/**
 * Breathes whatever it is applied to between its natural size and [scale].
 *
 * `@Composable` rather than `composed`: the body genuinely needs composition to
 * remember the transition, and `composed` is the deprecated way to get it — it
 * allocates a fresh modifier on every composition and opts the whole chain it
 * sits in out of skipping, which is the opposite of what an always-animating
 * element wants.
 *
 * The pulse holds still at its resting size under `@Preview` and in screenshot
 * tests; see [rememberLoopingFloat] for why that is load-bearing.

    // composition, which would keep it that way. graphicsLayer takes a lambda
